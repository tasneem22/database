READ COMMITTED CASE
Question 1
they don't show the same results, the first shows the old table,
while the second shows the new one after editing it, 
and this is because we haven't committed the changes we did in the second terminal



Question 2
after committing , now both terminals show same results

Question 3
and same happened while updating the balance in two different terminls without committing any changes , 
so the second terminal couldn't see the changes happened to the first
